     * them has completed, and all reads started no later than this completion have also completed (signalled by an
     * OpOrder which the strategy assumes all readers subscribe to).
     *
     * The OpOrder recycling strategy holds queues of indexes available for recycling. The queues ar organized in blocks
     * of REUSE_BLOCK_SIZE entries. The blocks move through the following stages:
     * - Being filled with newly released indexes. In this stage they are at the head of the "justReleased" list. When
     *   a block becomes full, a new block is created and attached to the head of the list.
     * - Full, but the mutation that released one or more of the mutations in them has not yet completed. In this stage
     *   they are attached to the "justReleased" list as the second or further block. When a mutationComplete is
     *   received, all such blocks get issued a common OpOrder.Barrier and are attached to "awaitingBarrierTail" (which
     *   is the tail of the "free" list).
     * - Awaiting a barrier. In this stage they are in the "free" list after its head, closer to its
     *   "awaitingBarrierTail", identified by the fact that their barrier has not yet expired. Note that the blocks are
     *   put in the order in which their barriers are issued, thus if a block has an active barrier, all blocks that
     *   follow it in the list also do.
     * - Ready for use. In this stage they are still in the "free" list after its head, but their barrier has now
     *   expired. All the indexes in such blocks can now be reused, and will be when the head of the list is exhausted.
     * - Active free block at the head of the "free" list. This block is the one new allocations are served from. When
     *   it is exhausted, we check if the next block's barrier has expired. If so, the "free" pointer moves to it.
     *   If not, there's nothing to reuse as any blocks in the list still have an active barrier, thus we grab some new
     *   memory and refill the block.
     * - If a mutation is aborted by an error, we throw away all indexes in the "justReleased" list. This is done so
     *   that none of the indexes that were marked for release, but whose parent chain may have remained in place,
     *   making them reachable, are reused and corrupt the trie. This will leak some indexes (from earlier mutations in
     *   the block and/or ones whose parents have already been moved), but we prefer not to pay the cost of identifying
     *   the exact indexes that need to remain or be recycled.
     *   We assume that exceptions while mutating are not normal and should not happen, and thus a temporary leak (e.g.
     *   until the memtable is switched) is acceptable. Should this change (e.g. if a trie is used for the full lifetime
     *   of the process or longer and exceptions are expected as part of its function), we can implement a reachability
     *   walk to identify orphaned indexes and call it with some frequency after one or more exceptions have occured.
