/**
 * Writes vectors to a file indexed by ordinal position.

 * This class provides efficient sequential and sparse writing of vectors to disk.
 * Vectors are stored at positions calculated as: ordinal * dimension * Float.BYTES.
 * This allows for direct random access reading by ordinal.
 * <p>
 * The writer supports:
 * - Sequential writes (ordinal increases by 1 each time)
 * - Sparse writes (ordinals can have gaps, which are left as zeros)
 * - Efficient buffering via BufferedRandomAccessWriter
 * This class is not thread-safe and should only be used within the vector index package.
